Predict The Future Price of Ethereum using Binance and Python machine learning

The rise of cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrency is a major topic of discussion recently as its market cap surged to a record $2 trillion in April 2021. To put that into comparison, the market cap of Apple, a 45 year old company has a market cap of around 2 trillion dollars as well.
If you don’t know about cryptocurrencies yet, it might be the time to start learning about them. They are branded as the future of not just money, but many processes and operations that power our day-to-day lives. In simple terms, it’s like an amalgamation of cryptography, programming, and finance.
Talking about cryptocurrency, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, right behind Bitcoin. Its main purpose is to help execute decentralized smart contracts. As of today, its market cap is larger that big companies like Walmart, Netflix and Disney.
In this article, I will be predicting the price of Ethereum for the following year.
Predicting cryptocurrency price
Predicting cryptocurrency price is difficult and some might even say it’s a waste of time, this is because of how volatile it is, especially since it’s still nascent in its development. Some people say that cryptocurrency is like internet in the 1980s, and I think that describes it very well.
Nonetheless, predicting cryptocurrency price is a very interesting topic and can be a fun project to work on if you’re interested in time series analysis, in finance or data science in general.
Time Series data
Cryptocurrency price, like stock price, is a time series data. As you know, there are many different algorithms in machine learning, each have their own purpose for different use cases.
